# Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Sentence-Similarity-with-Emphasis-on-Negation-Handling

🧠 Project Description:

Automated answer evaluation systems require precise understanding of sentence-level semantics to ensure fair and accurate grading. Traditional approaches often fail when it comes to linguistic nuances such as negations, conjunctions, or complex sentence structures, which can lead to biased or incorrect grading.

To address this, our project presents a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Negation-Aware Sentence Similarity Detection, designed to significantly enhance automated evaluation systems and similar NLP applications.

🚀 Key Features:

🧬 Multimodal Embedding Fusion:

Integrates powerful language models including BERT, RoBERTa, Sentence-BERT, and Word2Vec to construct rich and context-aware sentence representations.

🔁 Siamese Bi-LSTM Architecture:

Utilizes a Siamese Network with Bi-directional LSTM to compute semantic similarity scores between sentence pairs.

🚫 Negation & Conjunction Awareness:

Specially trained on datasets containing negated and conjunctive sentences, ensuring the model handles “not”, “never”, “although”, etc., effectively.
